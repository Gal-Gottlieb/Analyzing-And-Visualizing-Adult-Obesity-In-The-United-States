# Analyzing And Visualizing Adult Obesity In The United States
Analyzing and visualizing adult obesity in the United States by Tableau and Excel.




Here is a link to a visualization in my Tableau Public profile:

A phone-friendly version of the project has also been made for the convenience of phone users - here is its link:

This analysis was conducted using data from the Tableau Public Resources (link below) named US County Health Rankings:
https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/resources

* The CSV file is located in the repository under the name "Original County Health Rankings Data Set".




Project goals include identifying factors associated with adult obesity in the United States and offering suggestions on how to address it to authorities like the federal,
state, and local governments.

The project was done to help officials such as James, Governor of California, find out which factors are responsible for the high adult obesity levels, so he could take
measures to reduce the obesity rate among adults.

* James' persona profile is included in a PowerPoint file in the repository.



First, I cleaned and prepared the data using Excel software.
After I cleaned and prepared the data, I saved the edited Excel file as "Edited Original County Health Rankings Data Set".

The CSV file can be found in the repository under the name "Edited Original County Health Rankings Data Set".

Then I used Tableau software to create a story - a sequence of visualizations.

Here are the chapters of the story I created:

1- The Obesity Epidemic Among Adults

2- Project Description

3- Adult Obesity Rate Varies Between Regions

4- Measures With Little Effect On Adult Obesity

5- Factors That Contribute To Adult Obesity

6- Analysis of Top Adult Obesity States In Each Region

7- Conclusion And Recommendations

8- Methodology and a description of the measures in the data set.
